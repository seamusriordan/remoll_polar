Repository information is here:

---------------------------------------------------


Packages to build this:

>=Geant4.9.6
cmake > 2.6
root
python
git (optional)
boost (optional)

---------------------------------------------------

Instructions:

To build, create the directory you would like to 
build in, say build

mkdir build
cd build
cmake <path to remoll>
make

The field map can be found in the main directory Map.dat

It just needs to be downloaded and for the example, present in the directory
you are running in.  Otherwise, specify it in the macro as in the
exmaple provided in macros/  An example macro will be found in 

macros/runexmaple.mac

You need to load libremollroot.so if you want to access 
the classes written out to the ROOT files.  Building
remoll will create a rootlogon.C which will do this
automatically.

To run in batch mode, execute with a macro such as:

./remoll runexample.mac


==== Visualization ===============

Visualization macros are found in vis/

To run, execute

./remoll 

which should bring up a graphical command interface

To see the geometry:

/control/execute macros/vis.mac
